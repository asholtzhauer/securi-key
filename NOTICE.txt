----------------------------------------

This is a very simple Linux module (currently) that is designed to help prevent privilege escalations (or de-escalations).

Once the module is installed, it will intercept the system call table and swap out three system calls: setuid, setresuid, and kill with custom versions of these system calls. The custom version first performs a check of a file before executing the system call. If the check fails, the process is killed before the system call is executed. Otherwise, the system call is permitted to be executed.

Check out the project wiki for more detailed info on how to use this module, and also its limitations.

NOTE: I take no responsibility for this module somehow damaging your kernel or any security breaches. Use this module at your own risk, it's not infallible or an end-all security measure.
